To use GPG gen-key with our typical settings:

    gpg --full-gen-key --openpgp

Choose RSA and RSA; this is typically the default.

Choose 4096 bits; this is typically the strongest.

Choose expiration date in one year; this is to be safe.

To list:

   gpg --list-key $email

To export:

   gpg --armor --export $email --output $email=gpg_public_key.txt

   gpg --armor --export-secret-key $email --output $email=gpg_private_key.txt
